# Roadmap

This is what I would like to have in my HUD in the future. I'm happy for anyone to tinker with my HUD to include these listed.

- Proper UI scaling for resolutions other than 1920x1080
- Customization options for *HUD positioning*, *width of the player icons in the match status bar* and *[Hypnootize’s custom crosshairs](https://github.com/Hypnootize/TF2-HUD-Crosshairs)*

I may implement your work into the HUD and give you proper credit.
